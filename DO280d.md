## Deploying Applications

If we are using YAML files that are stored in GIT for updating application to another version, we need to change the git branch where the second version is stored then can apply the YAML.

```
git brnach                        (lists the branches available for the git repo)
git checkout <branch-name>        (switch branch where the secondversion is stored)
oc apply -f .                      (apply the resources)
oc rollout restart deployment/<dep-name>          (when apply the changes(2nd version) we need to restart the pods, use this command)
```
